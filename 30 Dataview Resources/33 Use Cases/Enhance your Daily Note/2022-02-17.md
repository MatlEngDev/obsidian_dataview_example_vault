# Good day, it's 2022-02-17

## My Day

- Today was quite nice weather despite the cold
- Went to eat some Cake with Emre
- And here is some filler text that explains what I did today, what I learned and ... things you do all day, really

## My Tasks

- [x] Meet with Emre
- [ ] Cleanup the fridge
- [x] Hand in the last home work

### Leftovers
> [!info] Used query: [[List tasks from a certain daily value under a heading]]
```dataview
TASK 
FROM "10 Example Data/dailys" 
WHERE file.day = date("2022-02-16") AND meta(section).subpath = "Gonna do this tmrw"
```
_**Still open - deal with it it or remove it!**_
> [!info]- Used query:  [[Get latest open tasks]]
> With two adjustments: First, we filter out our current note with `AND file.day != date("2022-02-16")` - and secondly, instead of the latest tasks we get the _oldest_ task via `SORT file.day ASC`
```dataview
TASK
FROM "10 Example Data/dailys"
WHERE status = " " AND file.day != date("2022-02-16")
SORT file.day ASC
LIMIT 3
```

## Looking back and forward

### Things that happened or will happen on February 17
> [!info] Used query: [[List bullet points from dailys of a specific date without year]]
```dataview
LIST file.lists.text
WHERE dateformat(file.day, "MM-dd") = "02-17" AND file.day.year != this.file.day.year
SORT file.day ASC
```

> [!attention] This doesn't want to work. To the rescue, mnv. :( 

> [!info] Used query: [[Show all list items containing a specific metadata value]]
```dataview
LIST L.due
FROM "10 Example Data/dailys"
FLATTEN file.lists AS L
WHERE contains(L.due, file.day)
```
